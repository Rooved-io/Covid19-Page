### What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
-	Fever
-	Fatigue/tiredness
-	Dry cough

Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 
These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. 
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical advice.


### When should I be tested for COVID-19?
Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.
As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritizing testing in the following groups:
-	hospitalized patients with severe respiratory infections;
-	symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;
-	cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
-	patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;
-	elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions.

### When can I have the results?
Results usually come within 24 hours after testing begins in the lab.
