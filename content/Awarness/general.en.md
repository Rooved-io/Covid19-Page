### Similarities and differences – COVID-19 and influenza

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, comparisons have been drawn to influenza. Both cause respiratory disease, yet there are important differences between the two viruses and how they spread. This has important implications for the public health measures that can be implemented to respond to each virus.

### What are the symptoms?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
-  Fever
- Tiredness
- Dry cough

Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 
These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. 
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
