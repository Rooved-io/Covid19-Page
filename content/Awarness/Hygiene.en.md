### How do I raise my immunity?
A well rounded diet, exercise, and good water intake.

### Cleaning clothes management?

Linens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry of an ill person:
- Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and then discard after each use. If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed. 
    * If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash hands afterwards.
    * If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.
    * Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.
    * Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered.

### Ariel OR Persil?
It doesn’t matter

### Secretions of patient?

To contain respiratory secretions, a medical mask should be provided to the patient and worn as much as possible. Individuals who cannot tolerate a medical mask should use rigorous respiratory hygiene − that is, the mouth and nose should be covered with a disposable paper tissue when coughing or sneezing. Materials used to cover the mouth and nose should be discarded or cleaned appropriately after use (e.g., wash handkerchiefs using regular soap or detergent and water). 
Avoid direct contact with body fluids, particularly oral or respiratory secretions, and stool. Use disposable gloves and a mask when providing oral or respiratory care and when handling stool, urine and other waste. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves and the mask. 

Clean and disinfect daily surfaces that are frequently touched and may contain secretions in the room where the patient is being cared for, such as bedside tables, bedframes and other bedroom furniture. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (i.e., equivalent to 5000 pm or 1 part bleach to 9 parts water) should be applied. 


### How do I dispose of Garbage?
Waste from possible cases and cleaning of areas where possible cases have been (including disposable cloths and tissues):
1. Should be put in a plastic rubbish bag and tied when full.
2. The plastic bag should then be placed in a second bin bag and tied.
3. It should be put in a suitable and secure place and marked for storage until the individual’s test results are known.
Waste should be stored safely and kept away from children. You should not put your waste in communal waste areas until negative test results are known or the waste has been stored for at least 72 hours.
●	if the individual tests negative, this can be put in with the normal waste
●	if the individual tests positive, then store it for at least 72 hours and put in with the normal waste



### Toilet management?
If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces.
