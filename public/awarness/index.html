<h3 id="what-is-a-coronavirus">What is a coronavirus?</h3>
<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-covid-19">What is COVID-19?</h3>
<p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-covid-19">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>
<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Tiredness</li>
<li>Dry cough</li>
</ul>
<p>Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 
These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don&rsquo;t feel unwell. 
Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. 
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek contact NUMBER</p>
<h3 id="similarities-and-diferences--covid-19-and-influenza">Similarities and diferences – COVID-19 and influenza</h3>
<p>As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, comparisons have been drawn to influenza. Both cause respiratory disease, yet there are important differences between the two viruses and how they spread. This has important implications for the public health measures that can be implemented to respond to each virus.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-covid-19-and-influenza-viruses-similar">How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?</h3>
<p>Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.
Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-covid-19-and-influenza-viruses-different">How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?</h3>
<p>The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. 
Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 
The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.<br>
Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.
While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.
Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.
Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.</p>
<h3 id="what-medical-interventions-are-available-for-covid-19-and-influenza-viruses">What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?</h3>
<p>While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-covid-19-spread">How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
<p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.</p>
<p>The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. 
These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. 
Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-virus-that-causes-covid-19-be-transmitted-through-the-air">Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3>
<p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.</p>
<h3 id="can-covid-19-be-caught-from-a-person-who-has-no-symptoms">Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3>
<p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-catch-covid-19-from-pets">Can I catch COVID-19 from pets?</h3>
<p>There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. To protect yourself clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-catch-covid-19-from-infected-surfaces-or-packages-from-infected-areas">Can I catch COVID-19 from infected surfaces or packages from infected areas?</h3>
<p>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</p>
<p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).</p>
<p>If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
<p>Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?</p>
<p>Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.</p>
<h3 id="best-awareness-cases">Best awareness cases</h3>
<p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</li>
<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
<p>Maintain at least 1-meter distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p>Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-avoid-touching-eyes-nose-and-mouth">Why should I Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h3>
<p>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</p>
<p>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
<p>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.</p>
<h3 id="are-some-people-more-at-risk-than-others">Are some people more at risk than others?</h3>
<p>Elderly people above 70 years of age and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females.</p>
<h3 id="are-children-also-at-risk-of-infection-and-what-is-their-potential-role-in-transmission">Are children also at risk of infection and what is their potential role in transmission?</h3>
<p>Children make up a very small proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, with about 1% of all cases reported being under 10 years, and 4% aged 10-19 years. Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease. There is still some uncertainty about the extent to which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children transmit disease.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-risk-of-infection-in-pregnant-women-and-neonates">What is the risk of infection in pregnant women and neonates?</h3>
<p>There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date.
ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-treatment-for-the-covid-19-disease">Is there a treatment for the COVID-19 disease?</h3>
<p>There is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease.
Healthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus, and provide supportive care (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) for infected persons, which can be highly effective.
In severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials. Several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available.
As this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans.</p>
<h3 id="when-should-i-be-tested-for-covid-19">When should I be tested for COVID-19?</h3>
<p>Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.
As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritizing testing in the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>hospitalized patients with severe respiratory infections;</li>
<li>symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;</li>
<li>cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;</li>
<li>patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;</li>
<li>elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions.</li>

<p>If you have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading follow the guidance outlined in question 15. (What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?) and do the following:
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3°C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. 
If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.</p>
<p>Why?
Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.</p>
<p>Why? 
Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-treatment-options-for-covid-19-including-drugs-vaccines-therapies">What are the treatment options for COVID-19 (including drugs, vaccines, therapies)?</h3>
<p>re antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-medicines-or-therapies-that-can-prevent-or-cure-covid-19">Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?</h3>
<p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-vaccine-drug-or-treatment-for-covid-19">Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h3>
<p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
<p>Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.</p>
<p>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-wear-a-mask-to-protect-myself">Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</h3>
<p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-put-on-use-take-off-and-dispose-of-a-mask">How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.</li>
<li>Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water</li>
<li>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.</li>
<li>Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).</li>
<li>Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).</li>
<li>Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.</li>
<li>Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.</li>
<li>After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.</li>
<li>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
<li>Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="is-there-anything-i-should-not-do">Is there anything I should not do?</h3>
<p>The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-19 and can be harmful:</p>
<p>Smoking
Wearing multiple masks
Taking antibiotics</p>
<p>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cope-with-stress-during-covid-19">How do I cope with stress during COVID-19?</h3>
<p>It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or angry during a crisis. Talking to people you trust can help. Contact your friends and family.
If you must stay at home, maintain a healthy lifestyle - including proper diet, sleep, exercise and social contacts with loved ones at home and by email and phone with other family and friends.
Don’t use smoking, alcohol or other drugs to deal with your emotions. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor. Have a plan, where to go to and how to seek help for physical and mental health needs if required.
Get the facts. Gather information that will help you accurately determine your risk so that you can take reasonable precautions. Find a credible source you can trust such as WHO website or, a local or state public health agency.
Limit worry and agitation by lessening the time you and your family spend watching or listening to media coverage that you perceive as upsetting.
Draw on skills you have used in the past that have helped you to manage previous life’s adversities and use those skills to help you manage your emotions during the challenging time of this outbreak.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-am-immune-compromised-or-have-immune-compromised-children">What should I do if I am immune-compromised or have immune-compromised children?</h3>
<p>People with underlying medical conditions, such as a compromised immune system, liver disease, cancer, kidney disease, heart disease and diabetes mellitus, need to take more precautions to protect themselves against all infections, including COVID-19.
We recommend people take the following simple steps to protect yourself and others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid close contact with people with cold or flu-like illnesses.</li>
<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing.</li>
<li>Wash hands for at least 20 seconds with water and soap and dry them thoroughly:</li>
<li>before eating or handling food</li>
<li>after using the toilet</li>
<li>after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose or wiping children’s noses</li>
<li>after caring for sick people. 
Additional measures that you and your friends can take include:</li>
<li>If you are immune-compromised, avoid staying with a person who is self-isolating (because they are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have recently travelled overseas.)</li>
<li>You should stay at least 1 meter away from people who are unwell, if you are immune-compromised.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also important that everyone helps to protect the safety of immunocompromised people living in our community. For example, if you’re unwell, avoid contact with someone who is immune-compromised.</li>
<li>We recommend checking safe travel advice about COVID-19 if you plan overseas travel.</li>
<li>At this time, it wouldn’t make sense for someone who is immune-compromised to wear a mask when in public to decrease risk for catching COVID-19. However, if your health care provider advises you to wear a mask when in public areas because you have a particularly vulnerable immune system, follow that advice.</li>
<li>If you are taking immunosuppressive drugs we advise that you do not stop this medication without first consulting your GP or specialist.</li>
